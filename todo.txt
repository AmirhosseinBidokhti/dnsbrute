// Clean up and refactor todos
    UTILS (file reading, file making, folder making, file deleting)
    
    Uniquing the files (choose the approach)

    Adding help

    Adding dynamic input recieving from cli (argv)
      -w filepath (wordlist file)
      -r resolver (resolver file)
      -d domain.tld (domain.tld passed)

    Deleting the unwanted files generated by subdomain finders and stuffs

    Adding a cool banner

    

// Functions
    Subdomains (find proper way to exec command. error handling in the process)
      crt.sh
      subfinder
      abuseip
      wordlist -> Subdomains

    Merging all subdomains results (ready for shuffle dns)
    Since suffledns and dnsgen they both work by getting a filepath.
    This is why we need to work around with files.
